<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing the B.S. degree in IntelliSense Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering. I'm exploring the field of **Simultaneous Localization And Mapping(SLAM)** and **Visual Language Navigation(VLN)** in the Collaborative Localization Research Group which is led by Prof. Zou DanPing now.

Although I haven't decided on my final research direction yet, my interest is particularly piqued by the perception of agents, equipping a brain in a vat with senses. I believe this is the first step towards achieving embodied intelligence. I can't wait to explore the frontiers of human knowledge and bring ideas into real life. To fulfill this goal, I study subjects broadly, from hardware to software and from control to instrument, preparing myself to do more interesting and impressive work in the future.

# üìù Research Experience 
- *2024 - now* **Collaborative Localization Research Group**. The supervisor of this project is Prof. **Danping Zou**, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I work closely with PhD students in the Collaborative Localization Research Group. In the Collaborative Localization Research Group, I have completed the following tasks:
  1. Attempted to utilize text - based ID information for loop closure detection in SLAM.
  2. Constructed a semantic keyframe map and developed a comprehensive interactive interface for it.
  3. Assisted senior students in conducting UAV-related experiments.

- *2023 - 2024* **Drone-Assisted Multi-Sensory Autonomous Driving System**. The supervisor of this project is **Yanbo Liu**, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Considering that relying solely on onboard sensors limits the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving, introducing a multi-sensory system to perceive road conditions is an effective solution. We propose the Drone-Assisted Multi-Sensory Autonomous Driving System which consists of a vehicle perception system, a blind spot detection system, a drone control system, a drone perception system, and a driving decision system. I am a co-first author of our paper 'Drone-Assisted Multi-Sensory Autonomous Driving System', which has been accepted for presentation at The 31st CHINA-SAE Congress \& Exhibition(SAECCE) and awared as Excellent Paper.

# üéñ Honors and Awards
- *2024* **Mathematical Contest In Modeling**, the Meritorious Winner. 
- *2023* **China-U.S. Young Maker Competition Final**, the First Prize of Main Track & the Intel Excellence Award.
- *2023* **Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling**, the Second Prize in Shanghai.
- *2023* **TI Cup National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest**, the Second Prize in Shanghai.
